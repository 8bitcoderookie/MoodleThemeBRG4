Moodle BRG4 Theme
=================

This theme is based on the "base" Theme by Sam Hemelryk which comes with standard [Moodle](https://moodle.org/).

The current version is tested with [Moodle 2.5](http://download.moodle.org/)

Besides the look this theme enhances Moodle by the following features:

- add accesskey L to all pages Login/Logout toggle
- add accesskey E to all pages Edit on/off toggle
- fill-in helper for top category creation
- fill-in helper for sub category creation
- fill-in helper for course creation
- insert username if provided as fragment in URL
- auto-select Markdown as the default input format for textarea elements if 'When editing text' is set to 'Use standard web forms' in the user profile on all pages
- edit course topic: removes the 'Use default section name' check mark and sets focus to the section name textfield on page load
- frontpage: collapses all top categories exept the first two (Waltergasse and current school year)
- course request page: insert info for mandatory data to be provided.
- assignment: sync cut off date with due date; once activated it is set to due date by default
- assignment: enable Submission comments by default
- assignment: disable default email notification for graders.
- Profile Links lead to edit Profile page directly
