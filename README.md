Moodle BRG4 Theme
=================

This theme is based on the "base" Theme by Sam Hemelryk which comes with standard Moodle.

The current version is tested with Moodle 2.5

Besides the look this theme enhances Moodle by the following features:

- add accesskey L to all pages Login/Logout toggle
- add accesskey E to all pages Edit on/off toggle
- fill-in helper for top category creation
- fill-in helper for sub category creation
- fill-in helper for course creation
- insert username if provided as fragment in URL
- auto-select Markdown as the default input format for textarea elements if 'When editing text' is set to 'Use standard web forms' in the user profile on all pages
- edit course topic: removes the 'Use default section name' check mark and sets focus to the section name textfield on page load
- frontpage: collapses all top categories exept the first two (Waltergasse and current school year)
- course request page: insert info for mandatory data to be provided.
- assignment: sync cut off date with due date; once activated it is set to due date by default
- assignment: enable Submission comments by default
- assignment: disable default email notification for graders.
- Profile Links lead to edit Profile page directly
